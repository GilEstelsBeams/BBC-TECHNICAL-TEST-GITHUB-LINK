# GAME OF LIFE

This programme is built using Python and especially Pygame

Although settings can be set from the file, when running the code you will have the option to modify the settings.

Specific features include:
1) You can click on cells to make them alive or kill them
2) You can create a "Torus-like" space where borders are actually connected to each other
3) There are 3 potential starting points: 'drawn' where you draw yourself the alive cells, 'number' where you choose a number N such that 1/N is the probability a cell is alive.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

1)Launch the programme (can easily change display variables there)
2)The game will launch in a new window (for me it does not pop up in the front automatically, I have to find it in my list of open applications)
3)The game is paused before starting, shown by the yellow background. 
4)You can pause or unpause with the space key, the change in background colour indicates if the game is running.
5)For drawing or killing new cells it is advised to pause the game. You can press the mouse continuously, no need to click each cell individually.
6)To restart the board from the beginning use the backspace key.
7)To switch the 'torus' mode on or off (each border is linked to its opposite), press 't'.
8)To change the speed of the game, use the up and down arrow. (Note: with my current code this also influences the drawing experience.)
9)To end the game close the window or press escape.


POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:

1) Link the file to a Front-End programme for a better presentation of the choice of parameters.
2) Increase the reactivity to clicks, so that the drawing of cells is smoother.
3) Make the game window pop up in the front.
