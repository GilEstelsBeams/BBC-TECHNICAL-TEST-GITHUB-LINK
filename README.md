# GAME OF LIFE

This programme is built using Python and especially Pygame

Although settings can be set from the file, when running the code you will have the option to modify the settings.

Specific features include:
1) You can click on cells to make them alive or kill them
2) You can create a "Torus-like" space where borders are actually connected to each other
3) There are 3 potential starting points: 'default' with a 1/2 probability a cell is alive, 'drawn' where you draw yourself the alive cells, 'number' where you choose a number N such that 1/N is the probability a cell is alive.

Potential improvements for this game:
1) Link the file to a Front-End programme for a better presentation of the choice of parameters
2) Increase the reactivity to clicks, so that the drawing of cells is smoother
